BOOKDOWN all the way....

## My notes

AS I have been working on this I have now converted my projects into a bookdown project. This is helping me prepare to build my thesis in `bookdown` but also so that I can manage these documents better. I am currently writing a series of blogs on doing this below:

<div class="post">
<ul>
{% for post in site.tags["beech"] %}
  <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a> ({{ post.date | date_to_string }})<br>
    {{ post.description }}
{% endfor %}
</ul>
</div>
