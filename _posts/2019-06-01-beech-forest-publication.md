## Status

*Pre-registration*: not needed

## Working Title

*Merky forests. What can we expect from stoat control in NZ forests? - Food vs. Predation.*

## Overview

This publication clarifies the discrepancy between; two modelling papers that suggest mesopredator release of rodents is possible in New Zealand forest systems and; several field studies that have presented limited but conflicting support for increases in mouse abundance following predator control. We used an experimental design to test the differences between the two "frames of though" and found that there is no evidence to suggest mice will become more abundant after predator removal ([*additional resources for collaborators here*](https://www.dropbox.com/home/phd-drafts-anthony)).
